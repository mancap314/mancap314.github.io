<p>Machines are already strong by themselves, but their potential gets truly
unleashed when they can communicate with each other. Web servers enable this
communication by taking requests from and sending back responses to other
machines. Here we will see how to implement a very simple web server in C for
Linux. You can find the complete code for it on <a href="https://github.com/mancap314/cwebserver/">this repo</a>.</p>

<h2 id="main-ingredients-sockets-and-addresses">Main ingredients: sockets and addresses</h2>
<p>A web-server (and its counterparts the web-clients) in Linux deal mainly with
two kinds of objects: <em>socket</em>s and <em>address</em>es. You can imagine sockets as
mail-boxes. Those mail-boxes have some characteristics like the size of the
messages they can get, how they can get them, how many at the same time etc.</p>

<p>Adresses are like… yes, addresses, but more specific than post addresses.
Imagine there are different ways to come to a given place: through the highway,
through the little alley, and then different doors… in an <em>address</em> here you
would have to specify all that.</p>

<h3 id="server-side">Server side</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create the server socket. This is done through the function <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/socket.7.html">socket()</a> returning a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor">file descriptor</a>. It takes as arguments a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">domain</code> (here <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AF_INET</code> for the IPv4 protocol), a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">type</code> (here <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SOCK_STREAM</code>  for “sequenced, reliable, two-way, connection-based byte streams”) and a protocol (here <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> for the default protocol).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create the server address: it’s a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">struct sockaddr_in</code> where you have to
specify the domain, the address proper and the port (note that you have to
convert the port number (integer) with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">htons()</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bind the socket to the address: here basically you put the mailbox at the
address defined above. You do it with the function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bind()</code> taking as
arguments the file descriptor for the socket, a pointer to the address and
its length.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Listen: the socket listens for incoming connections with the function
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">listen()</code>. It takes as argument the file descriptor of the (now binded) socket, and the size of the backlog (how many connections can be registered simultanously).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now there is a infinite loop calling each time <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">accept()</code>: this halts the
routine until there is an incoming connection, that gets accepted. This
acceptation attaches the client socket to the (server socket + address).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the server socket, the address and the client socket are attached
together, the server can <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">read()</code> messages from and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">send()</code> messages to
the client.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the communication is finished, the server <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">close()</code> the client socket
on its side.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="client-side">Client side</h3>
<p>The process is a bit simpler on the client side:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create the client socket, the same way than for the server.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create the address (object) corresponding to the server address. Note that
you may have to convert the IP address with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inet_pton()</code> to store it in the
right format in the field <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sin_addr</code> of the server address (see
implementation).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Connect the client socket with the server address just defined. Note that
the server socket is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bind</code>ed to the server address, and the client socket
is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">connect</code>ed to it. However, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">connect()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bind()</code> take the same
argument.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the client can <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">read()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">send()</code> messages with the server.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>And hurray, both machines can communicate!!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is a very simple implementation of a webserver (and a webclient) in C,
that can be easily extended, for example to use concurrency (multi-threading)
to handle multiple incoming connections on server-side, and/or to make it a
HTTP server, or to communicate through radio
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AX.25">AX.25</a>). The possibilities are countless
from there!</p>

<p>Many details could not be covered here, it would need an entire book to cover
the whole topic. But don’t hesitate to read the doc regarding the various functions used here. Just typ for example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man socket</code> in the terminal to get it.</p>
