There seems to be a bit confusion about what is a computer virus, so here an article clarifying it hopefully. A *computer virus* is not necessarily a *malware*, and there are many other types of malwares than viruses. This is better summarized with a small schema:

![Malware vs. Virus](assets/virus-malware.png)

Most viruses are malwares currently, but many malwares are not viruses.


So the question still holds: What is precisely a virus? Tada... suspens... it's a program that creates a variant of itself in a given environment.

NB:
* a variant of itself can be precisely itself, but doesn't have to 
* the environment may be a computer, or a browser in the case of a javascript virus etc.

## A bit of history
The word *virus* applied to computer programs was first coined by [Leonard Adleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Cohen) as he was supervising the PhD of [Fred Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Cohen) at the University of South California (4 miles from where I am writing this article btw.). This dissertation was completed in 1986 and was the first to formalize computer viruses. However, there were already viruses at that time, like [Elk Cloner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk_Cloner). At that time it was just a timid beginning, nothing compared to what is going on nowadays...

## Formalization
Before diving into the formalization of a virus, we should first introduce what is a *Turing Machine*
### Formalization of a Turing Machine
A *Turing Machine* is the abstraction of a computer program (whereas the formalization of a computer would be a *Universal Turing Machine*). So what is a Turing Machine? There are many ways of formalizing it. You can get a good overview in this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine). Basically, it consists in two parts:
* a *band* (also called *tape*) containing symbols, let say *0* and *1*. This band is of infinite length
* a *head* reading symbols on the band. This head has a *Reader/Writer* that can read the current symbol on the band and eventually replace it by another one, and a *state*. Depending on the current read symbol and its current state, the head can perform 3 actions:
1. Write another symbol on the current position of the band
2. Move of 1 position on the right or on the left (or stay at the same place)
3. Update its own internal state

Illustration of a Turing Machine:

If the head comes to a point where it does nothing, then the program is executed and *halts*.

The formalization we adopt here for a Turing Machine is the following:
* $$S(t)$$: state of the head at time (indice) $$t$$
* $$C(t, i)$$: content of the cell $$i$$ (on the band) at time $$t$$
* $$P(t)$$: position of the head (indice of the cell where it's positioned) at time $$t$$

### Formalization of a virus
Now the question is, what is a virus on a Turing machine? It's simply a sequence on the band of a Turing Machine $$M$$ that gets reproduced to itself or a variant (evolution) of itself. Note that the same sequence on the band of another Turing Machine $$M'$$ may not reproduce: a virus is a virus only relatively to a given machine (environment).



Here a schematic illustration:

NB: The *virus reproduction* can be an exact copy of the virus itself, or a variant of it. On the machine $$M$$, a virus $$v$$ can produce first a variant $$v_1$$ of itself, $$v_1$$ producing then a variant $$v_2$$ of itself etc. The set $$\{v, v_1, v_2, \dots\}$$ is called the *viral set* of $$v$$. A *viral set* can be be of size 1 (the virus produces each time an exact copy of itself), of size 2, 3 etc. until infinity, means there are in this case infinitely many variations of the virus. The viral set of a virus $$v$$ is noted $$V$$.

Now the formal definition of a virus... Brace yourself and don't worry, the explanation follows:

$$V$$ is a viral set (for a Turing Machine $$M$$) if:
$$
\forall v \in V: \\ 
[\exists t, j \in \mathbb{N}\space such\space that: \\
P(t) = j\space (1.1) \\
and\space S(t) = S(0)\space (1.2) \\
and\space \big(C(t, j), \dots, C(t, j + \mid v\mid -1)\big) = v\space (1.3)] \\
\Rightarrow \\
[\exists v'\in V, t', j' \in \mathbb{N} \space with\space t'>t \space such\space that: \\
j' + \mid v'\mid \leq j\space or\space j + \mid v\mid \leq j'\space (2.1) \\
and\space \big(C(t', j'),\dots,C(t', j'+\mid v'\mid-1)\big)=v'\space (2.2) \\
and\space \exists t'' \space such\space that:\space \\
\hspace{3em} t<t''<t'\space \\
\hspace{3em} and\space P(t'')\in \{j',\dots,j'+\mid v'\mid-1\}\space (2.3)]
$$

**Explanation**

If:
* 1.1: at time $$t$$, the head of $$M$$ is at the cell $$j$$
* 1.2: and the head is at its initial state
* 1.3: and the cell $$j$$ and the following cells contain $$v$$ [ $$\mid v\mid$$ is the length (number of fields) occupied by $$v$$ on the band]

Then later at time $$t'$$ the head is at the cell $$j'$$ such that:
* 2.2: $$j'$$ and the following cells contain $$v'$$
* 2.1: the cells containing $$v$$ and $$v'$$ are separated, they don't overlap
* 2.3: the head was positioned at a cell belonging to $$v'$$ at a time $$t''$$ after $$t$$ but before $$t'$$ ($$t'$$ is the time where the head finishes to write $$v'$$ on the band, so it just means that the head was previously writing $$v'$$)

And because $$v$$ and $$v'$$ belong the the same viral set $$V$$, $$v'$$ is an reproduction/evolution of $$v$$.

## Remarks
* A virus doesn't have to contain a damaging payload. It's not part of the definition.
* In its article *Computer Viruses: Theory and Experiments* (1987), Fred Cohen gives an example of a legitimate virus: a compiler compiling a copy of itself. Hence in the first figure, the set of viruses is not completely contained inside the set of malwares.
* There is no antivirus capable of detecting any virus. This can be easily proved by contradiction. Imagine such an antivirus, let's call it *AV*, exists. Now imagine a programm *w* that reproduces itself if *AV* says it's not a virus: then *w* is by definition a virus ; and doesn't reproduce itself if *AV* says it's a virus: then *w* is by definition not a virus: the existence of such an antivirus would lead to a contradiction.

## Conclusion
This article is a purely formal definition of what is (and by contrast what is not) a virus. It bases in a large part on the book *Computer Viruses: from theory to applications* by [Ã‰ric Filiol](https://sites.google.com/site/ericfiliol/) which I warmly recommend. I hope it demystified a bit the notion of *computer virus* and made you curious. I will probably come later with more practical articles about viruses, but at least we know now what we are talking about.
