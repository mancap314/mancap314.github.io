<h1>A bit about this blog and me...</h1>

<p>This blog keeps track of experiments, readings etc. I found interesting, especially in topics regarding machine/deep learning. Among them, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are my favorits I must confess, but others are also interesting. I have been working myself around data since several years by now, as research assistent, data integration specialist and data scientist. If I can help you, just <a href="/contact.html">tell me</a>.</p>
<p>Since a while I am also interested in computer viruses. It's a quite fascinating topics. Not to destroy anything, don't worry, besides hopefully the fantasies around them. There is no reason that only evil guys and some specialists study them.</p>
<p>Otherwise in my free time I like to play ping-pong and chess, both are (almost?) addictions, meet friends, from time to time read and travel...</p>
