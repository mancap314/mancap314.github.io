      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_chiffres_et_des_lettres">Des Chiffres et des Lettres</a> was a French TV game broadcasted from 1965 up until 2024, means almost 60 years long, a record. It consists in two games: <em>chiffres</em>, where you get a set of number and combine them to reach a target number as close as possible; and <em>lettres</em>, where you combine a set of letters to get the longest possible word. This article presents a solver for those games implemented in C.</p>

<h2 id="game-rules">Game Rules</h2>
<h3 id="chiffres">Chiffres</h3>
<p>In <em>chiffres</em> you get a set of positive integers, and you must combine them using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) to approach as close as possible a target number, which is also a positive integer. For example you get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5</code> and your target is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">36</code>. The best you can approach the target with those numbers is by reaching <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">35</code>, and there are two ways to do it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Solution 1:
    <ul>
      <li>10 - 3 = 7</li>
      <li>7 * 5 = 35</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Solution 2:
    <ul>
      <li>10 * 3 = 30</li>
      <li>30 + 5 = 35</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You are allowed to use each initial number and each intermediary result only once, no re-use. All intermediary results must be a positive integer as well.</p>

<p>In the TV version, there were 6 initial numbers sampled without from {1..10, 25, 50, 75, 100} and the target was sampled in {101..999}.</p>

<h3 id="lettres">Lettres</h3>
<p>For this game, 10 letters are sampled from the latin alphabet (26 letters). Each candidate chooses alternatively if he wants a vowel or a consonant to be picked are random, until there are 10 letters. With those 10 letters, you must form the longest possible valid french word. If a lwords contains accentuented letters like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">à</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">é</code>, they are considered non-accentuated for the purpose of this game (e.g. you can form the word “âme” with the letters <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">à</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e</code>).</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<h3 id="chiffres-1">Chiffres</h3>
<p>At the beginning we have a list of numbers, all marked as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unused</code>. The first two numbers are picked, and combined with an operation. If the result is invalid (negative or fractional), then pass. Otherwise mark those two numbers as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">used</code>, the result is appended to the list of numbers, and from there we proceed recursively. The result is structured in a set of <em>solution</em>s containing <em>step</em>s. A step consists in three positive integers (the two operands and the result) and the operation (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> or…). If a better solution is found, the set of solutions is re-initialized, so that the final result contains only solutions for the best possible result.</p>

<p>N.B.:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A solution is “better” than another if it approximates the target better, or if it approximates the target with the same precision, but has a less number of steps</li>
  <li>If some numbers are repeated in the input, some solutions maybe repeated, since each repeated number is considered distinct in this implementation</li>
</ul>

<p>On top of this, there is also a mechanism to avoid <em>dead steps</em>, means steps which results are not used to compute the final result.</p>

<p>Let’s try:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{sh}">./chiffres_lettres.o --chiffres --target 594 --values 8,5,75,100,9,3
[INFO] Solving chiffres with following parameters:
        - chiffres: 8, 5, 75, 100, 9, 3
        - target: 594
[INFO] All combinations computed for 6 chiffres in 0.26s.
SUCCESS
Best solution(s) found:
- 2995512 combinations computed (from which 1173663 or 39.18% are valid)
- Min. delta to target reached: 0.
- 4 solutions:
solution 1:
        1. 8 * 75 = 600
        2. 9 - 3 = 6
        3. 600 - 6 = 594
===
solution 2:
        1. 8 * 75 = 600
        2. 3 + 600 = 603
        3. 603 - 9 = 594
===
solution 3:
        1. 8 * 75 = 600
        2. 600 - 9 = 591
        3. 3 + 591 = 594
===
solution 4:
        1. 9 - 3 = 6
        2. 8 * 75 = 600
        3. 600 - 6 = 594
===
</code></pre>

<p>This output displays the numbers of combinations (steps) computed. A combination is invalid if it produces a negative or fractional number. Interestingly, the percentage of valid steps is pretty stable, around 38 +- 2% most of the time empirically. It’s also pretty fast, as you can see. You can also notice that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">solution 1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">solution 4</code> are the same, just we steps in a different order. A possible improvement would be to remove such identical solutions, or better, not compute them in the first place (though I implemented already some mechanisms to reduce quite drastically the numbers of computed steps, that would be quite overwhelming otherwise in a naïve implementation).</p>

<p>In the current implementation, you can input max. 10 numbers containing max. 10 digits, and it computes max. 10 solutions.</p>

<h3 id="lettres-1">Lettres</h3>
<p>All the permutations of the input letters are combined with a (non-recursive) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap%27s_algorithm">Heap’s algorithm</a>. For the list of French words, I used the one made by <a href="http://www.pallier.org/">Christophe Pallier</a> in his <a href="http://openlexicon.fr/">openlexicon</a> containing 336k+ French words. For each permutation, we use binary search to find the longest word in this list starting with the same letters (modulo accents).</p>

<p>For example I was curious to find out which are the longest French words containing the first 10 letters of the alphabet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{sh}">./chiffres_lettres.o --lettres --values abcdefghij     
[INFO] Solving for lettres with following parameters:
        - lettres: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J
[INFO] main(): number of lines in liste.de.mots.francais.frgut.txt: 336531
[INFO] main(): 336531 words loaded from dictionnaire file in 0.100s.
[INFO] main(): matches for 10 letters found in 0.673s.
matches:
        * fichage
        * déficha
</code></pre>
<p>Ok, both contain 7 letters.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It’s a pretty efficient implementation of a solver for <em>des chiffres et des lettres</em>, that could be extended to other languages. Feel free to try. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/mancap314/chiffres_lettres">this Github repo</a>. If someone would like to use it as a backend for an app to play this game, it would be great :)</p>
